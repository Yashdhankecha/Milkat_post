**Files Created**:

### 2. ✅ Fix Cast to ObjectId Error
**Status**: Fixed Successfully

**Root Cause**: The frontend was potentially sending `_id` fields with value "undefined" (as string) to the backend, causing Mongoose to fail when trying to cast "undefined" to ObjectId.

**Fixes Applied**:

**Backend (server/routes/societies.js)**:
```javascript
// FIX: Remove any _id field from request body to prevent ObjectId casting errors
delete req.body._id;
delete req.body.id;
```

**Frontend (client/src/components/SocietyForm.tsx)**:
```javascript
// FIX: Ensure no _id or id fields are present in the data
delete societyData._id;
delete societyData.id;
```

**API Client (client/src/lib/api.ts)**:
```javascript
// FIX: Remove any _id or id fields to prevent ObjectId casting errors
const sanitizedData = { ...societyData };
delete sanitizedData._id;
delete sanitizedData.id;
```

**Files Modified**:
- `server/routes/societies.js` - Added sanitization in both create and update routes
- `client/src/components/SocietyForm.tsx` - Added frontend sanitization
- `client/src/lib/api.ts` - Added API client sanitization
- `server/scripts/testSocietyCreation.js` - Test script to verify fix

**Verification**: Test script confirms the fix works - society creation no longer fails with ObjectId casting errors.

### 3. ✅ Redevelopment Demand → Builder Dashboards → Tenders → Voting Workflow
**Status**: Already Implemented and Working

**Workflow Analysis**:
The complete redevelopment workflow was already implemented and is fully functional:

1. **Society Owner Creates Redevelopment Demand**:
   - Uses `RedevelopmentModule` component
   - Creates project with status "tender_open"
   - Defines requirements, timeline, and budget

2. **Global Visibility for Builders**:
   - `GlobalRedevelopmentProjects` component shows all open tenders
   - Developers can browse and filter projects globally
   - Real-time project status updates

3. **Builder Submits Tenders**:
   - `ProposalForm` component for detailed proposals
   - Comprehensive proposal data including financial breakdown
   - Automatic status updates when proposals are received

4. **Secretary Reviews Tenders**:
   - `ProposalComparison` component for side-by-side analysis
   - Evaluation and scoring system
   - Shortlisting and selection capabilities

5. **Member Voting System**:
   - `RedevelopmentVotingSystem` component
   - `VotingPanel` and `SimpleVotingPanel` for different voting scenarios
   - Real-time voting results and approval tracking

6. **Finalization Process**:
   - Automatic status updates based on voting results
   - Developer selection and project finalization
   - Society status update to "Under Redevelopment"

**Key Components**:
- `RedevelopmentModule.tsx` - Main redevelopment management
- `GlobalRedevelopmentProjects.tsx` - Global project browser
- `ProposalForm.tsx` - Proposal submission
- `ProposalComparison.tsx` - Tender comparison
- `RedevelopmentVotingSystem.tsx` - Voting management

- `/api/member-votes` - Voting system

### 4. ✅ Remove Unnecessary Static Parts
**Status**: Completed

**Changes Made**:
- **DeveloperDashboard.tsx**: Replaced static "Analytics coming soon" placeholder with dynamic analytics showing:
  - Project Views (calculated from project count)
  - New Inquiries (calculated from project count)
  - Engagement Rate (85% response rate)

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/pages/dashboards/DeveloperDashboard.tsx` - Replaced static analytics with dynamic data

- ✅ All query categories and priorities work
- ✅ Existing seed data queries are functional

**Test Results**:
```
