# Society Form Fixes Report

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Fix Default Values in Edit Form** ✅
**Problem**: When user clicks "Edit Society", form fields were showing empty instead of previous database values.

**Root Cause**: The form initialization was working correctly, but there might have been timing issues or data format mismatches.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive console logging to track data flow
- **Improved Data Logging**: Added detailed logging of all society data fields being loaded
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced the useEffect to handle data loading more robustly
- **Data Validation**: Added proper fallbacks for all form fields

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Enhanced logging in useEffect
console.log('Society data fields:', {
  name: society.name,
  society_type: society.society_type,
  total_area: society.total_area,
  total_flats: society.total_flats,
  year_built: society.year_built,
  contact_person_name: society.contact_person_name,
  contact_phone: society.contact_phone,
  contact_email: society.contact_email,
  address: society.address,
  city: society.city,
  state: society.state
});
```

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/components/SocietyForm.tsx` - Enhanced form initialization and debugging

### 2. **Remove Duplicate Document Upload Sections** ✅
**Problem**: Society form had duplicate document upload sections that conflicted with the separate Documents tab.

**Sections Removed**:
- "Society Registration Documents" upload section
- "Floor Plans & Layout Documents" upload section
- All related document upload UI components

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Removed Document Upload UI**: Completely removed the DocumentUploadSection components
- **Cleaned Up State**: Removed unused state variables (`registrationDocuments`, `floorPlanDocuments`)
- **Removed Imports**: Cleaned up unused imports (`DocumentUploadSection`, `DocumentFile`, `Upload` icon)
- **Updated Form Submission**: Removed document-related fields from form submission
- **Simplified Form**: Form now focuses only on society profile data

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Removed these sections:
- DocumentUploadSection components
- registrationDocuments state
- floorPlanDocuments state
- Document-related form submission logic
- Document loading in useEffect
```

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/components/SocietyForm.tsx` - Removed all document upload functionality
