# Owner Dashboard Enhancement Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive enhancements made to the Society Owner Dashboard (`http://localhost:3000/society-owner/dashboard`) to address all requested improvements and fixes.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Uploaded Documents Section** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Uploaded documents were not being displayed anywhere in the dashboard.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **New Documents Tab**: Added a dedicated "Documents" tab to the main dashboard navigation
- **Backend API**: Created `GET /api/societies/:id/documents` endpoint to fetch society documents
- **Frontend Integration**: Added `getSocietyDocuments()` method to API client
- **Dynamic Display**: Documents are fetched from database and displayed in a clean card/grid layout
- **Features**:
  - View documents in new tab
  - Download documents
  - Document type badges (Registration/Floor Plan)
  - Upload date display
  - Empty state with call-to-action
  - Real-time document count in tab badge

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/pages/dashboards/SocietyOwnerDashboard.tsx` - Added documents tab and UI
- `client/src/lib/api.ts` - Added `getSocietyDocuments()` method
- `server/routes/societies.js` - Added documents endpoint

### 2. **Fix Society Update Form** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Society update form was not properly updating information due to field name mismatches.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Field Mapping**: Fixed camelCase (backend) to snake_case (frontend) field name transformation
- **Backend Transformation**: Added field transformation in all society routes (create, update, fetch)
- **Frontend Debugging**: Added console logging to track data flow
- **Form State Management**: Ensured proper form state initialization and updates

**Root Cause**: Backend model used camelCase field names (`societyType`, `totalArea`) while frontend expected snake_case (`society_type`, `total_area`).

**Files Modified**:
- `server/routes/societies.js` - Added field transformation in all routes
- `client/src/components/SocietyForm.tsx` - Added debugging and improved form handling

### 3. **Dynamic 6 Dashboard Cards** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: All 6 main cards were showing static data instead of real-time database values.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Card 1 - Total Flats**: Shows `society.total_flats` from database
- **Card 2 - Active Members**: Shows `members.length` from fetched member data
- **Card 3 - Total Blocks**: Shows `society.number_of_blocks` from database
- **Card 4 - Member Queries**: Shows `queries.length` and pending count from database
- **Card 5 - Redevelopment**: Shows redevelopment status from `society.redevelopmentStatus`
- **Card 6 - Documents**: Shows total document count from `registration_documents` + `flat_plan_documents`

**Features**:
- Real-time data fetching
- Dynamic counts and status indicators
- Proper error handling for missing data
- Responsive design with hover effects

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/pages/dashboards/SocietyOwnerDashboard.tsx` - Enhanced data fetching and card display

### 4. **Fix Invitation Handling** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Members who accepted invitations were still showing in pending invitations list.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Auto-refresh**: Added 30-second interval to automatically refresh member and invitation data
- **Manual Refresh**: Added refresh button for immediate data updates
- **Filtered Display**: Modified invitation list to show only pending/sent invitations
- **Backend Integration**: Leveraged existing backend logic that properly moves accepted members to society members list

**Features**:

- Manual refresh button
- Filtered invitation display (pending/sent only)
- Proper status indicators
- Real-time member count updates

**Files Modified**:

### 5. **Remove Invitation Section from Owner Dashboard** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: User requested removal of invitation section from main dashboard.

**Solution Implemented**:
