# File Upload System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive file upload system that follows the specified rules for different file types and storage strategies.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Upload Middleware (`server/middleware/upload.js`)
- **Complete rewrite** of the upload middleware with proper file type handling
- **Smart routing** based on file type:
  - Images/Videos → Cloudinary (memory storage)
  - PDFs → Local storage (disk storage)
- **File type validation** with comprehensive MIME type checking
- **Separate multer configurations** for different file types

### 2. Updated Upload Routes (`server/routes/upload.js`)
- **Complete rewrite** of all upload endpoints
- **Consistent file processing** using the new middleware
- **Proper error handling** for different file types
- **Storage type indication** in API responses

### 3. Enhanced Media Model (`server/models/Media.js`)
- **Added storage type detection** methods
- **Enhanced delete functionality** for both Cloudinary and local files
- **Improved URL transformation** (only for Cloudinary URLs)

### 4. Cleaned Up Old Logic
- **Removed temp-uploads directory** (no longer needed)
- **Eliminated mixed storage logic** from previous implementation
- **Consistent error handling** across all endpoints

## File Upload Rules Implemented

### ✅ Images and Videos
- **Storage**: Always uploaded to Cloudinary
- **Configuration**: Uses `memoryStorage` for efficient processing
- **Response**: Returns Cloudinary secure URL
- **Supported types**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM

### ✅ PDFs
- **Storage**: Always stored locally in `/uploads` folder
- **Configuration**: Uses `diskStorage` for direct file saving
- **Response**: Returns local server path (e.g., `/uploads/filename.pdf`)
- **Supported types**: PDF only

### ✅ Validation
- **File type checking** before processing
- **Proper error messages** for unsupported types
- **Size limits**: 100MB for videos, 50MB for PDFs
- **MIME type validation** for security

### ✅ Code Organization
- **Separate Cloudinary helper** functions
- **Dedicated multer configurations** for each file type
- **Consistent middleware usage** across all routes
- **Clean separation of concerns**

### ✅ Database/Schema
- **Correct URL storage**:
  - Cloudinary secure URLs for images/videos
  - Local paths for PDFs
- **Storage type tracking** in responses
- **Proper cleanup** on file deletion

## API Endpoints Updated

### `/api/upload/single`
- Handles single file uploads (any type)
- Routes to appropriate storage based on file type

### `/api/upload/multiple`
- Handles multiple file uploads
- Processes each file according to its type

### `/api/upload/property-images`
- **Images and videos only** (filters out PDFs)
- Optimized for property listings

### `/api/upload/society-documents`
- **PDFs only** (filters out images/videos)
- Optimized for document management

### `/api/upload/profile-picture`
- **Images only** (rejects videos and PDFs)
- Updates user profile automatically

### `/api/upload/:mediaId` (DELETE)
- **Smart deletion** based on storage type
- Handles both Cloudinary and local files

## File Type Support

| File Type | Storage | Max Size | Supported Formats |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Images | Cloudinary | 100MB | JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF |
| Videos | Cloudinary | 100MB | MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM |
| PDFs | Local | 50MB | PDF only |

## Error Handling

- **File type validation** with descriptive error messages
- **Size limit enforcement** with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Cloudinary service errors** handled gracefully
- **Local file system errors** properly caught and reported

## Security Features

- **MIME type validation** prevents malicious file uploads
- **File size limits** prevent abuse
- **User authentication** required for all uploads
- **Ownership verification** for file deletion

## Testing

- **File type detection** validated
- **Storage routing** confirmed
- **Error handling** tested
- **No linting errors** in any modified files

## Environment Requirements

### Cloudinary Configuration
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

### Local Storage
- `/uploads` directory automatically created
- Static file serving configured in `server.js`
- Proper file permissions handled

## Migration Notes

- **Existing files** in the system will continue to work
- **New uploads** will follow the new rules automatically
- **No database migration** required
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for existing URLs

## Performance Optimizations

- **Memory storage** for Cloudinary uploads (no temporary files)
- **Direct disk storage** for PDFs (no unnecessary processing)
- **Efficient file type detection** using MIME types
- **Proper cleanup** of temporary resources

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Upload success/failure** logging
- **File type and size** tracking
- **Storage type** indication in responses
- **Error details** for debugging (development mode)

---

## Summary

The file upload system has been successfully implemented according to all specified requirements:

✅ **Images and videos** → Cloudinary with secure URLs  
✅ **PDFs** → Local storage with server paths  
✅ **File type validation** with proper error handling  
✅ **Clean code organization** with separated concerns  
✅ **Database consistency** with correct URL storage  
✅ **Old logic cleanup** with no breaking changes  

The system is now ready for production use with proper file handling, security, and performance optimizations.
